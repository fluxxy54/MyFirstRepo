What I have learned from this course

One important thing Iâ€™ve learned so far in this course is how to apply critical thinking when analyzing data and solving problems. It has helped me approach challenges more logically, ask better questions, and make decisions based on evidence rather than assumptions. This skill is not only useful in academics but also in real-life situations, especially when working on projects that involve research or teamwork.
