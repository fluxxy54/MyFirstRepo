Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Youssef Amr, a 19-year-old Computer Science student with a strong passion for technology, leadership, and social impact. I specialize in web development, with hands-on experience in building responsive, user-friendly applications using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, C#, and Blazor. Iâ€™m also a volunteer graphic designer at an Islamic center, where I use visual design to communicate ideas and support community engagement.

Beyond coding and design, my mission is to bridge the digital divide by creating scalable, accessible educational platforms, especially in Africa. I believe that technology, when used responsibly, can empower individuals and drive meaningful change. I'm constantly seeking new knowledge and opportunities to grow, lead, and contribute to a better future.
